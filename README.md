## Instructions for shop project

This branch is just framework + tank code. You might see it fit to change some things.

FYI: I will be available to help, explain, and debug.

### Each period should:

- [x] Make their own branch, name it f-period or g-period
- [x] Make a folder for mechs (/frc/mechs)
- [x] Take a look at DriverContol.java and Tank.java (try to figure what type of control set() vs setPolar() offers you)
- [x] Adjust DriverControl according to the preferences of your period's driver (aka talk to them)
- [x] Code mechs (talk to mech leads, make sure you update the .txt file and instantiate them in Robot.java)
- [x] Code autonomous (there's 2 ways you can do this)
- [x] Try to make the driver's life easier by automating processes (like functions to set elevator heights or shooter angles)
- [x] Yell at everyone for taking away time for controls testing

Good luck :)
